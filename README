Welcome to T's Calculator

This is just a simple calculator class that uses RSpec for 
testing.

Right now it just has basic calculator functions like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, additive inverse.  It also has memory that will 
remember one value and allow you to add to or subtract from that value.

Happy Calculating,
